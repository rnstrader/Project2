## Preparation for App
reading in Seoul Bike sharing data for the year-long period from December 2017 through November 2018. Locale argument was included to allow data to read in properly, as the formatting for date seemed to be giving it trouble.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bike <- read_csv("SeoulBikeData.csv", locale=locale(encoding="latin1"))
bike
```
