## Preparation for App
reading in Seoul Bike sharing data for the year-long period from December 2017 through November 2018. Locale argument was included to allow data to read in properly, as the formatting for date seemed to be giving it trouble.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bike <- read_csv("SeoulBikeData.csv", locale=locale(encoding="latin1"))
```

One-way and Two-way contingency tables.
```{r}
holiday <- bike |> group_by(Holiday) |> summarize(count = n())
holiday

functioning <- bike |> group_by(`Functioning Day`, Seasons) |> summarize(count = n())
functioning
```

Numerical summaries for bike usage by season.
```{r}
summary <- bike |> group_by(Seasons) |> summarise(across(`Rented Bike Count`, .fns = list("mean" = mean, "median" = median, "var" = var, "sd" = sd), .names = "{.fn}_{.col}"))
summary
```

Six plots for investigating the data
```{r}

```
