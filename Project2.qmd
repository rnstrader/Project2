## Preparation for App
reading in Seoul Bike sharing data for the year-long period from December 2017 through November 2018. Locale argument was included to allow data to read in properly, as the formatting for date seemed to be giving it trouble.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bike <- read_csv("SeoulBikeData.csv", locale=locale(encoding="latin1"))
```

One-way and Two-way contingency tables. Due to the nature of bike count being a numeric variable with many possible values, I instead created a range of values for ease of viewing the table.
```{r}
holiday <- bike |> group_by(Holiday) |> summarize(count = n())
holiday

functioning <- bike |> group_by(`Functioning Day`, Holiday) |> summarize(count = n())
functioning
```

Numerical summaries for 
```{r}

```
